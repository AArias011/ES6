The state pattern has become popular with React's usage, and now most web development frameworks use it. Basically the state pattern is one were we hold the state of the application with all the data and properties needed, sometimes called props, in React. And when it changes, it updates the rendering of the application. And again, needless to say, React, Angular, and every state management library are a great example of its use. So let's take a look again at the React application we have in our resources, and look inside the app.js file.

Or look at the corresponding exercise files inside of this chapter. And then look at app.js here. And as we can see here, we are declaring a state inside of a class. So, and again, all of React's components are declared as classes, and it extends the component class that is defined in React's library. And then we're passing a constructor with props, which we're leveraging again from the library in the component.

And then we're declaring our state. So this is basically our state that we need and then that we can pass to our components. So this is a good representation of the state pattern, where we are declaring a state and leveraging the state inside of our application.
