The chain of responsibility is a pattern to help solve common practical issues of having a request from a client and needing this request to pass through multiple functions or logic to get the result. This is where chain of responsibility comes into play. So let's illustrate this one example. When you hit the buy button, this particular request goes through a series of functions to finalize the order, and they can quickly grow in complexity. So you hit the buy button, then the application needs to check if you're logged in, then needs to check if it has your address.

If not, add an address. Then it needs to calculate the taxes, shipping, process payment, and finally, process the order and display a success message. Needless to say, this simple action of clicking Buy has several functions related to it. And if we are to build this application with a modular approach and pure functions, we're talking close to a dozen or more functions being written here. So this is where the chain of responsibility comes into play, and where we need to create a proper chain so these events occur in a linear way.

What we end up with is a request going through an abstract handler, which calls one function or handler after another until the chain is completed. When one handler is completed, we can go to the next one. If there are errors, the abstract handler can provide error information to the back end and client. And so on and so forth.
