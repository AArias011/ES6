# Unit Objectives
* Students will learn the fundamentals of advanced JavaScript.
* Students will learn OOP and design patterns in javascript. 
* Students will learn about Immutibility.


# Tech Standards
- 4.2 Choose the appropriate data type for a given situation
- 4.3 Identify the correct syntax and usage for constants and variables in a program
- 4.6 Research industry relevant programming languages, i.e. JavaScript
- 14.1 Use standard library functions
- 14.2 Find and use third party libraries (e.g. web-based, package managers)
- 18.1 Make a distinction between an object and a class
- 18.2 Differentiate among inheritance, composition, and class relationships
- 18.3 Instantiate objects from existing classes
- 18.4 Read the state of an object by invoking accessor methods
- 18.5 Change the state of an object by invoking a modifier method
- 18.6 Determine the requirements for constructing new objects by reading the documentation
- 18.7 Create a user-defined class
- 18.8 Create a subclass of an existing class
- 18.9 Identify the use of an abstract class as opposed to an interface
- 18.10 Explain the object-oriented concepts of polymorphism, inheritance, and encapsulation 


## Sub-Unit 1 - Advanced Javascript
**Goals**:
  1. Students will identify the correct syntax and usage for constants and variables.
  2. Students will research industry relevant programming languages, i.e. JavaScript
  3. Students will find, use and create third party libraries (package managers).
  4. Students will differentiate between interpreted and compiled code (e.g. steps necessary to run executable code)
  5. Students will identify the purpose of a build systems and bundlers (e.g. make, rake, ant, maven, SCons, grunt, gulp)
  - var, let, const and block scope.
  - functions, arrow functions, 
  - setting up gulp, babel, webpack, parcel, rollup.
  - npm, import, export, require


## Sub-Unit 2 - Design Patterns
**Goals**:
  1. Students will learn OPP and design patterns.
  2. Students will identify the correct software design patterns and usage.
  3. Students will find, use and create third party libraries (e.g. web-based, package managers)
### Creational Patterns
  - Constructor 
  - Singleton
  - Factory
  - Abstract
### Structural patterns
  - Module 
  - Mixins
  - Facade
  - Decorator
### Behavioral patterns
  - Observer
  - State
  - Memeto
  - Iterator

## Sub-Unit 3 - Immutibility
**Goals**:
  1. Students will identify the correct usage for constants and immutable methods.
- arrays, objects, mutations & immutability.
